\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Hopefully you remember me from a few years back. My name is Nick Butts. I worked at John Deere from 2000 to 2010. Back in October, Andy Norby and I had lunch and caught up on old times. Andy and I went to school together and we were in the same fraternity together. Andy told me about the reorganization at John Deere and asked if I would be interested in coming back. I've also talked with Tim Scott over the years and caught up with him back in October. It doesn't appear there are any open positions at John Deere at the moment, but I thought I would write you and kindly ask for your consideration if a position opens up in your group. If you would like I can send you my resume for your review.

\lettersection{Why John Deere?}
You may be asking why I would like to come back to work for John Deere. I left John Deere in 2010 due to being recruited by Bob Weinmann and a few others at Appareo systems. I wasn't actively looking for a new job, but the work seemed interesting. I had just finished my Masters degree and had spent a good deal of time working with computer vision and what would soon become the breakthrough in AI, deep neural networks. I have learned a great deal working at Appareo and am thankful for the experience. But times have been tough for Appareo and I would like to get back to a products company. I would like to work at a company that has a strong identity and wants to invest in its own products and future.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've spent a fair amount of my time at Appareo working on agricultural products. I've done work very similar to what I worked on at John Deere. I believe my skill set would be of benefit to John Deere. I have worked on a great many technologies and have obtained a number of patents in the area of sensors and machine intelligence.
