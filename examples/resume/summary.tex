Current Chief Engineer Projects, Directory of Technology Development/Proof of Concepts at Appareo Systems. 21 years of experience designing, building, and fielding rugged embedded systems. I am a passionate, enthusiastic, and results driven engineer.
I enjoy all aspects of embedded systems, from system engineering and architecture to embedded software design, from code and testing to electronics design and PCB layout. I've worked with bare-metal deeply embedded control systems to high end Linux based AI camera systems. I enjoy solving complex problems with an innovative and focused team. I push myself to continuously learn new technologies and tools.
